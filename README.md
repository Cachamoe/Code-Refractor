## Overview
This website was created in order to help businesses get found through search engine optimization, helping to manage their online reputaton, and expanding their influence by marketing through social media. I refractored the code given the acceptance criteria: 


```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
